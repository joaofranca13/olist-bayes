### Olist Ecommerce Dataset

The datasets utilized in this analysis are available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce.

This is a real dataset, that has been anonymised, containing information of 100k orders made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil, from 2016 to 2018.

### Merging the datasets

The data was divided in multiple datasets, for this analysis we will merge those datasets into one.

The steps performed for merging all the seven datasets are in the [Merging Notebook](https://github.com/joaofranca13/olist-bayes/blob/master/src/merging.ipynb).
